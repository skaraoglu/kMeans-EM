In this assignment we implement k-Means algorithm and Expectation maximization methods. We conduct the experiment on three part; first we evaluate the clustering results for Gaussian distribution datasets, following,
we utilize k-Means algorithm for image compression, further we employ the algorithms on Mall Customers dataset.

# Introduction

In this project, we focus on implementing the k-Means clustering algorithm and Expectation Maximization (EM). First we implement the algorithms from scratch with providing information about their mathematical background. Then we proceed to experiment with the algorithms on different datasets. In this assignment, we employ 3 different dataset; first dataset is the Gaussian distribution data provided with the project assignment, second dataset is 4 different images to apply compression by using k-Means clustering and finally we conduct the experiment with the Mall Customer dataset provided by UCI Machine Learning Repository and compare the scores calculated with 4 different metrics.
